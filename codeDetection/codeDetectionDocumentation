Description of the QR, barcode and 2D barcode work, conducted on 10.02.2021
3 scripts were created, all using the same name for the input image! So be careful, the script will fail 
if the image does not contain the type of the code the script detects!

QR codes are relatively simple to detect and decode as there is an QRCodeDetector class in the OpenCv.
For the barcode detection, one must use pyzbar lirary.

conda install -c conda-forge pyzbar

Alternative installation, for RPi or for non-Anacodna framework:
https://pypi.org/project/pyzbar/

N.B. Be sure to use pip3 install!

Finally, for 2D barcode detection, pylibdmtx was used

conda install -c conda-forge pylibdmtx

Alternative installation, for RPi or for non-Anacodna framework:
https://pypi.org/project/pylibdmtx/

Be sure to do:
pip3 install pylibdmtx
sudo apt-get install libdmtx0a

N.B. last command might need to be replaced with (letter b in the end):

sudo apt-get install libdmtx0b
