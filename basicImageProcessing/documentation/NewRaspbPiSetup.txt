Download OS image, format SD card, flash it.

Create new empy file called "SSH" in the boot folder of SD card.
Win Command prompt: fsutil file createnew SSH 0
Linux: use "touch" command

Start the Pi and connect it to the PC via ethernet cable. Download and start Putty.
Type "raspberrypi.local" into hostname, set the port to 22 and Open.

login as: pi
pi@raspberrypi.local's password: raspberry


sudo raspi-config
Enable SSH and VNC

Download VNC viewer
type raspberrypi.local in the adress box and login, same as above.

Set up the pi, create new password.
New pass: d...a..27 and you know the rest :)
Type passwd in terminal and follow instructions. 

Now, make the VNC server start at the startup.
cd /home/pi
cd .config
mkdir autostart
cd autostart
nano tightvnc.desktop

Copy paste this into the file, save & exit.

[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=TightVNC
Exec=vncserver :1
StartupNotify=false

Use raspi-config to adjust the resolution (don't put the highest option).
Disable wifi (not mandatory) so the LAN network is always prefferable (it will run faster).

Static IP setup:

If the wifi is enabled on the Pi, there might some troubles when trying to connect to it using the ethernet cable and the 
raspberrypi.local default hostname. Use: ping raspberrypi.local to show it's current IP adress, providing that it is connected via ethernet cable! 
That IP can then be used to connect to it via SSH or VNC. Next steps describe setting up the static IP adress.

Run: ip -4 addr show | grep global

Should give an output like:
inet 10.1.1.30/24 brd 10.1.1.255 scope global eth0
inet 10.1.1.31/24 brd 10.1.1.255 scope global wlan0

The first address is the IP address of your Pi on the network, and the part after the slash is the network size. It is highly likely that yours will be a /24.
The second address is the brd (broadcast) address of the network.

Find the address of your router (or gateway):

ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3}'
10.1.1.1

Finally note down the address of your DNS server, which is often the same as your gateway:

cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Generated by resolvconf
nameserver 10.1.1.1

Now edit /etc/dhcpcd.conf file using:

sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

This is the input that has been placed into dhcpcd of the first working Rasperry Pi for THEIA project, labeled as Bayes1.

interface eth0
static ip_address=169.254.219.135/16
static routers=10.0.0.1
static domain_name_servers=10.0.0.1

interface wlan0
static ip_address=10.0.0.4/24 
static routers=10.0.0.1
static domain_name_servers=10.0.0.1

Static IPs now can be used on the local wifi network to SHH or VNC into the PI. New wifi = new setup, via local connection.
