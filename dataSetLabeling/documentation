First, labelImg software was installed using:

pip3 install labelImg

Its installation folder was added to PATH, so it can be executed from terminal. To do it permamently,
and not only for the current terminal session, ~/.bashrc file was edited, which is a startup file for default shell.

sudo nano .bashrc

add this at the end of the file:

PATH="/home/luxc/.local/bin:$PATH"

Run the software with: labelImg
