These notes will document basic Ubuntu 18.04 PC setup for working in the THEIA project.
First, install Anaconda. After you've installed Anaconda, it is added to /.bashrc as a PATH and it is used as a main Python interpreter.
Therefore, all the Python modules should be aimed to be installed using "conda install" tool in the CLI, to avoid having to manually edit
the PYTHONPATH environmental variable.

conda install -c anaconda pyqt
conda install -c pytorch pytorch
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
conda install -c conda-forge keras
